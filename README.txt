Never note down another phone number again! This Ruby script uses the Twilio API and allows you to receive texts from voicemails. The script creates a transcript of the voice message and parses it into a text message. The text contains the name of the person and his/her phone number, so you don't need to retrieve contact information from voicemails manually.

If someone calls your Twilio number, they can leave a voice message which is sent as a text to your actual (non-Twilio) number.

Project created at BoilerMake, a hackathon at Purdue University on February 7-9, 2014 in collaboration with my teammate Anchal Agrawal. The ChallengePost submission page is at http://boilermake.challengepost.com/submissions/20632-callnotes.

Sample voice message: "My name is John Smith and my number is 1234567890." Received text: "Name: John Smith 123-456-7890."
